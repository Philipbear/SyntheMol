# Generating Novel Antibiotics with SyntheMol-RL

Instructions for generating antibiotic candidates for _Acinetobacter baumannii_ using SyntheMol-RL from the paper [TODO](TODO).

This includes instructions for processing antibiotics data, training antibacterial activity prediction models, generating molecules with SyntheMol, and selecting candidates. Assumes relevant data has already been downloaded (see [docs/README.md](README.md)).
