This directory contains instructions for reproducing the results in our two antibiotic generation papers.

## SyntheMol-RL

The instructions for reproducing the results from the paper [SyntheMol-RL: a flexible reinforcement learning framework for designing novel and synthesizable antibiotics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.17.654017v1), which uses the reinforcement learning (RL)
version of SyntheMol, are in [rl](rl).

## SyntheMol-MCTS

The instructions for reproducing the results from the paper [Generative AI for designing and validating easily synthesizable and structurally novel antibiotics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00809-7), which uses the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
version of SyntheMol, are in [mcts](mcts).
